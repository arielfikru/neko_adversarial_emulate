# Neko Adversarial Emulate

## Introduction

This project aims to emulate the workings of adversarial attacks but with a simpler and more cost-effective approach. The purpose is to understand and replicate the core concepts of adversarial attacks without the extensive computational requirements typically associated with such tasks.
